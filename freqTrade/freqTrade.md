# ðŸ“² Setting up Telegram Notifications for Freqtrade

This guide shows you how to set up Telegram with your Freqtrade bot to receive trade updates, errors, and interact with the bot via Telegram commands.

## âœ… Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`.
2. Start a chat and send the command:
```
/newbot
```
3. Follow the instructions to set up your bot.
4. BotFather will give you a **Bot Token** â€” save it securely.

## âœ… Step 2: Get Your Telegram Chat ID

1. Open a private chat with your new bot and **send it a message** like `/start`.
2. Visit the following URL in your browser (replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN` with your actual token)
```
https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_TOKEN/getUpdates
# Example
https://api.telegram.org/bot123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrSTUvwxYZ/getUpdates

```

3. Look for something like this in the JSON response:

```json
"chat": {
  "id": 123456789,
  "type": "private",
  "username": "yourusername"
}
Copy the ```id``` â€” this is your Telegram Chat ID.
